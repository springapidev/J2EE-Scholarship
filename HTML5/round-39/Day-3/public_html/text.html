<p>In <cite>The Brothers Karamazov</cite>, Dostoevsky wrote: 

</p> 
<blockquote cite="http://www.dostoevskybooks.com/the-brothers-karamazov/">
    <p>The stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The 
        stupider one is, the clearer <br/>one is. Stupidity is brief 
        and artless, while intelligence wriggles and hides 
        itself. Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is honest 
        and straightforward.</p>
